# rdrp_tree_experiments
Code, data and results of Muscle5 ensemble experiments on RdRp genus and phylum trees

## Installation

Clone the repository. Add `rdrp_tree_experiments/binaries` to your path. Download the `megacc` binary from the MEGA web site: [https://www.megasoftware.net/](https://www.megasoftware.net/) and copy to the `binaries/` directory.

## Dependencies

Python v3 is required.

## Running the analyses

The scripts `phylum/scripts/run` and `genus/scripts/run` re-run the analyses from scratch. This will take a few days on a typical multi-core server.

## Precomputed results

Most of the directories under `phylum/` and `genus/` contain intermediate and final results. There is a lot of stuff here, too much to document in detail. If you have any questions, open an issue in the github repostitory here: [https://github.com/rcedgar/rdrp_tree_experiments/issues](https://github.com/rcedgar/rdrp_tree_experiments/issues).
